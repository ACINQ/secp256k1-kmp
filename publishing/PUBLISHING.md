# Publishing secp256k1-kmp artifacts

## snapshots

Snapshots are published to the Sonatype snapshot repository (https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/).
To publish snapshot, you must add your sonatype credentials for the `ossrh` server to your local maven settings (typically in $HOME/.m2/settings.xml)

- Download `snapshot.zip` generated by the `Publish snapshot` github action
- unzip `snapshot.zip` in the `publishing` directory
- edit `secp256k1-kmp-snapshot-deploy.sh` and update the `VERSION` environment variable if needed
- run `secp256k1-kmp-snapshot-deploy.sh`

## releases

Releases are published to the Sonatype staging repository. If all items are valid they will be published to `maven central` repository.
You must edit `secp256k1-kmp-staging-upload.sh` and add your sonatype credentials. You must also have a valid GPG key.

- Download `release.zip` generated by the `Publish release` github action (which is triggered every time you publish a github release)
- unzip `release.zip` in the `publishing` directory
- edit `secp256k1-kmp-staging-upload.sh` and update the `VERSION` environment variable if needed
- sign all artifacts with a valid gpg key: `find release -type f -print -exec gpg -ab {} \;`
- run `secp256k1-kmp-staging-upload.sh`
- log into sonatype, close and publish your staging repository. Artifacts will be available on Maven Central within a few hours.
